# **TradieMate \- Job Management for Australian Tradies**

## **📋 PRODUCT CONCEPT**

### **Product Name: TradieMate**

**Tagline:** "Fair dinkum job management for Aussie tradies"

### **Core Problem Solved:**

* 80% of tradies waste 10+ hours/week on admin (quotes, invoices, scheduling)  
* Lost revenue from forgotten follow-ups and unbilled work  
* Unprofessional paper quotes lose jobs to competitors  
* Can't track job profitability until it's too late  
* Existing tools (ServiceM8, Tradify) are $49-99/month and overwhelming

### **Target Customers (Niche First Approach):**

1. **Primary:** Solo tradies (electricians, plumbers, carpenters) doing $200k-500k/year  
2. **Secondary:** Small crews (1 tradie \+ 1-2 helpers)  
3. **Tertiary:** Handyman services and maintenance businesses

### **Why Australia First:**

* 411,000 tradie businesses in Australia  
* High smartphone adoption (95%+ of tradies have iPhone/Android)  
* Strong tradie community culture (word-of-mouth works)  
* Existing tools are expensive and complex  
* Less competition than US/UK markets  
* Average tradie willing to pay $29-49/month for time savings

## **🚨 RISK MITIGATION**

### **Business Risks:**

❌ Risk: ServiceM8 drops price to compete  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- Focus on simplicity, not features  
   \- Build strong community (switching cost)  
   \- Annual plans lock customers in

❌ Risk: Tradies don't adopt digital tools  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- COVID proved tradies CAN go digital  
   \- Target younger tradies first (30-45 yo)  
   \- Show time saved, not tech complexity

❌ Risk: Can't reach enough tradies  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- Facebook groups have 200k+ tradies  
   \- Trade suppliers reach thousands  
   \- Referral program creates word-of-mouth

❌ Risk: Churn too high (tradies cancel)  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- Onboarding: Personal phone call  
   \- First quote: Hand-hold through first quote  
   \- Check-ins: Email after 7 days, 30 days  
   \- Success stories: Show how others benefit

### **Technical Risks:**

❌ Risk: App crashes on job sites (bad UX)  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- Offline mode (works without internet)  
   \- Thorough testing on slow connections  
   \- Error handling \+ retry logic

❌ Risk: SMS costs explode  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- Hard limits on free tier (0 SMS)  
   \- Cap SMS on Solo tier (50/month)  
   \- Email as backup delivery method

❌ Risk: Xero/MYOB integration breaks  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- Daily automated tests  
   \- Fallback: Manual CSV export  
   \- Monitor API status 24/7

### **Market Risks:**

❌ Risk: Australian economy slows (less construction)  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- Recession \= tradies need to be MORE efficient  
   \- Maintenance work is recession-proof  
   \- Target service tradies, not just builders

❌ Risk: Xero/MYOB changes API, breaks integration  
✅ Mitigation:  
   \- Monitor API deprecation notices  
   \- Have manual export as backup  
   \- Diversify: Support multiple accounting platforms

## **🎯 WHICH ONE TO BUILD?**

### **Quick Decision Matrix:**

| Factor | Voice Assistant | TradieMate |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Market Size** | Global (larger) | Australia (smaller but focused) |
| **Competition** | High (but fragmented) | Medium (expensive incumbents) |
| **Time to Revenue** | 3-6 months | 1-3 months (faster) |
| **Viral Potential** | High (sharing notes) | High (tradie word-of-mouth) |
| **Technical Complexity** | Medium (APIs) | Low (CRUD \+ PDF) |
| **Margin** | 70% | 85-90% |
| **Year 1 Revenue** | $135k-250k | $150k-220k AUD |
| **Churn Risk** | Medium | Low (switching cost high) |
| **Your Network** | ? | Do you know tradies? |

### **My Recommendation:**

**Build Voice Assistant IF:**

* ✅ You want global market potential  
* ✅ You're excited about AI/ML  
* ✅ You want venture-scale opportunity  
* ✅ You're okay with higher competition

**Build TradieMate IF:**

* ✅ You're in Australia or have Aussie connections  
* ✅ You want faster path to profitability  
* ✅ You want lower competition  
* ✅ You prefer B2B2C (tradie-to-tradie referrals)  
* ✅ You want "boring" but profitable SaaS

### **Hybrid Strategy:**

**Build Voice Assistant, then TradieMate** (or vice versa)

* Use profits from first to fund second  
* Diversify revenue streams  
* Learn from first product  
* Timeline: Start \#2 after \#1 hits $10k MRR

# **Voice-Enabled Input Strategy for TradieMate**

---

## **🎯 WHY VOICE INPUT IS CRITICAL FOR TRADIES**

### **The Tradie Reality:**

**Typical Job Site Scenario:**

**├─ Hands dirty/wet/oily**

**├─ Wearing gloves**

**├─ Holding tools**

**├─ On ladder/scaffold**

**├─ Poor lighting**

**├─ Time pressure (client waiting)**

**└─ Phone in pocket**

**Problem: Typing on phone \= nightmare**

**Solution: Voice input \= game changer**

### **Tradie Pain Points Voice Solves:**

**❌ Without Voice:**

**├─ "Can't type with gloves on"**

**├─ "Phone screen doesn't work when wet"**

**├─ "Takes 5 mins to type quote items"**

**├─ "Client watching me fumble with phone"**

**└─ "Easier to write on paper" (defeats purpose)**

**✅ With Voice:**

**├─ "Just say the items out loud"**

**├─ "Done in 30 seconds"**

**├─ "Looks professional"**

**├─ "Can do it while packing tools"**

**└─ "Actually faster than paper"**

---

## **📱 VOICE INPUT METHODS & USE CASES**

### **Method 1: Native Voice Dictation (Basic, FREE)**

**How it works:**

**Uses built-in iOS/Android keyboard voice input**

**├─ User taps text field**

**├─ Taps microphone icon on keyboard**

**├─ Speaks**

**└─ Text appears**

**Cost: $0 (built into OS)**

**Accuracy: 85-95% (depends on accent, background noise)**

**Languages: 50+ languages supported**

**Best for:**

* **✅ Client names, addresses**  
* **✅ Job descriptions**  
* **✅ Notes/comments**  
* **✅ Quick text fields**

**Example Flow:**

**Quote Line Item Entry:**

**Traditional typing:**

**┌─────────────────────────┐**

**│ Description:            │**

**│ \[Install downlights x6\] │ ← Takes 20 seconds to type**

**│                         │**

**│ Quantity: \[6\]           │**

**│ Unit Price: \[$45.00\]    │**

**└─────────────────────────┘**

**Voice dictation:**

**┌─────────────────────────┐**

**│ Description:            │**

**│ 🎤 \[Tap mic\]            │ ← User speaks: "Install downlights times six"**

**│ "Install downlights x6" │ ← Appears in 3 seconds**

**│                         │**

**│ Quantity: \[6\]           │ ← Already populated from speech**

**│ Unit Price: \[$45.00\]    │ ← User says "forty five dollars"**

**└─────────────────────────┘**

---

### **Method 2: Smart Voice Commands (Custom, AI-Powered)**

**How it works:**

**App listens for structured commands**

**├─ User presses "Voice Quote" button**

**├─ Speaks entire quote in one go**

**├─ AI parses speech into structured data**

**└─ Quote auto-generated**

**Cost: \~$0.05 per quote (using Deepgram \+ Claude)**

**Accuracy: 95-98% (custom AI parsing)**

**Example Voice Input:**

**Dave (on job site):**

**🎤 "Create quote for John Smith,** 

    **phone zero four one two three four five six seven eight,**

    **address one two three Main Street Parramatta,**

    **install six downlights at forty five each,**

    **labour two hours at one hundred fifty per hour,**

    **switchboard safety check one fifty,**

    **total with GST"**

**TradieMate processes:**

**├─ Extracts: Client name, phone, address**

**├─ Parses: Line items with quantities and prices**

**├─ Calculates: Subtotal, GST, total**

**└─ Creates: Complete quote in 5 seconds**

**Result:**

**┌─────────────────────────┐**

**│ Client: John Smith      │**

**│ Phone: 0412 345 678     │**

**│ Address: 123 Main St,   │**

**│          Parramatta     │**

**│                         │**

**│ LINE ITEMS:             │**

### **Method 3: Voice Templates (Hybrid Approach)**

**How it works:**

**Pre-built templates with voice fill-ins**

**├─ User selects template (e.g., "Downlight Installation")**

**├─ App prompts for variables**

**├─ User speaks answers**

**└─ Quote built automatically**

**Cost: $0 (uses native speech recognition)**

**Accuracy: 95%+ (structured prompts reduce errors)**

**Example Flow:**

**🎤 Voice-Guided Quote Creation:**

**App: "Select quote template"**

**User: Taps "Downlight Installation"**

**App: "How many downlights?"**

**User: 🎤 "Six"**

**App: ✅ Quantity set to 6**

**App: "Labour hours?"**

**User: 🎤 "Two hours"**

**App: ✅ Labour set to 2 hours**

**App: "Additional items?"**

**User: 🎤 "Switchboard safety check"**

**App: ✅ Added switchboard check ($150)**

**App: "Client name?"**

**User: 🎤 "John Smith"**

**App: ✅ Client set**

**App: "Quote ready. Review or send?"**

**User: Taps "Send via SMS"**

**Total time: 30 seconds**

### **Option 1: FREE Native Voice (Recommended for MVP)**

**iOS Implementation (React Native):**

**import Voice from '@react-native-voice/voice';**

**const VoiceQuoteInput \= () \=\> {**

  **const \[isListening, setIsListening\] \= useState(false);**

  **const \[transcript, setTranscript\] \= useState('');**

  **const startListening \= async () \=\> {**

    **try {**

      **await Voice.start('en-AU'); // Australian English**

      **setIsListening(true);**

    **} catch (error) {**

      **console.error(error);**

    **}**

  **};**

  **Voice.onSpeechResults \= (e) \=\> {**

    **setTranscript(e.value\[0\]); // Get spoken text**

    **parseQuoteFromText(e.value\[0\]); // Parse into quote fields**

  **};**

  **const parseQuoteFromText \= (text) \=\> {**

    **// Simple regex parsing or send to AI**

    **// Example: "Six downlights at forty five each"**

    **// Extracts: quantity=6, item="downlights", price=$45**

  **};**

  **return (**

    **\<View\>**

      **\<TouchableOpacity onPress={startListening}\>**

        **\<Icon name="microphone" /\>**

        **\<Text\>{isListening ? 'Listening...' : 'Tap to speak'}\</Text\>**

      **\</TouchableOpacity\>**

      **\<Text\>{transcript}\</Text\>**

    **\</View\>**

  **);**

**};**

**Cost: $0 (native APIs) Setup time: 2-4 hours Pros: Free, works offline, fast Cons: Less accurate for complex quotes**

---

### **Option 2: AI-Powered Voice (Premium Feature)**

**Using Deepgram \+ Claude:**

**import Deepgram from '@deepgram/sdk';**

**const AIVoiceQuote \= async (audioFile) \=\> {**

  **// Step 1: Transcribe audio**

  **const deepgram \= new Deepgram(process.env.DEEPGRAM\_API\_KEY);**

  **const response \= await deepgram.transcription.preRecorded(**

    **{ url: audioFile },**

    **{** 

      **model: 'nova-2',**

      **language: 'en-AU', // Australian English**

      **punctuate: true,**

      **diarize: false**

    **}**

  **);**


  **const transcript \= response.results.channels\[0\].alternatives\[0\].transcript;**

  **// Example: "Create quote for John Smith zero four one two..."**

  **// Step 2: Parse with Claude AI**

  **const anthropic \= new Anthropic({**

    **apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC\_API\_KEY**

  **});**

  **const message \= await anthropic.messages.create({**

    **model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',**

    **max\_tokens: 1024,**

    **messages: \[{**

## **🔗 INTEGRATIONS**

### **Accounting Software:**

Xero API:  
  Library: Custom implementation (REST API)  
  Sync: Invoices, Payments, Contacts, Tax Rates  
  Cost: FREE (Xero charges client, not us)  
  OAuth2: Automatic refresh tokens

MYOB API:  
  Library: Custom implementation (REST API)  
  Sync: Same as Xero  
  Cost: FREE  
  OAuth2: Automatic refresh tokens

QuickBooks (Phase 2):  
  Library: "node-quickbooks"  
  Less common in Australia, lower priority

#### **Implementation:**

// Supabase Edge Function: sync-xero  
import { XeroClient } from 'xero-node';

export async function syncInvoiceToXero(invoice) {  
  const xeroClient \= new XeroClient({  
    clientId: process.env.XERO\_CLIENT\_ID,  
    clientSecret: process.env.XERO\_CLIENT\_SECRET,  
    redirectUris: \['https://trademate.app/callback'\],  
    scopes: \['accounting.transactions'\]  
  });

  const xeroInvoice \= {  
    Type: 'ACCREC',  
    Contact: { Name: invoice.client.name },  
    LineItems: invoice.line\_items.map(item \=\> ({  
      Description: item.description,  
      Quantity: item.quantity,  
      UnitAmount: item.unit\_price,  
      AccountCode: '200' // Sales  
    })),  
    Status: 'AUTHORISED'  
  };

  const response \= await xeroClient.accountingApi.createInvoices(  
    tenantId,  
    { invoices: \[xeroInvoice\] }  
  );

  return response.body.invoices\[0\].invoiceID;  
}

## **🗺️ LOCATION & MAPS**

### **Google Maps Platform**

Services:  
  ✅ Maps SDK (display job locations)  
  ✅ Places API (address autocomplete)  
  ✅ Geocoding API (lat/lng from address)  
  ✅ Directions API (route to job site)

Cost:  
  \- Maps: $7 per 1,000 loads  
  \- Places Autocomplete: $2.83 per 1,000 requests  
  \- Geocoding: $5 per 1,000 requests  
  \- Free tier: $200/month credit

Estimate:  
  \- 1,000 users × 5 jobs/week \= 20,000 map loads/month  
  \- Cost: \~$140/month  
  \- Can optimize with caching

#### **Alternative (Cheaper):**

Mapbox:  
  Cost: FREE up to 100,000 loads/month  
  Then: $0.50 per 1,000 loads  
  Better pricing for high volume  
    
Decision: Start with Google (familiar), switch to Mapbox if costs high
